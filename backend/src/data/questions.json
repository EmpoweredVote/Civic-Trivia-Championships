In this situation, the bill automatically dies and cannot become law. Unlike a regular veto, a pocket veto cannot be overridden by Congress because Congress is no longer in session.",

This gives the President a powerful tool at the end of congressional sessions, allowing them to kill legislation without taking the political risk of an explicit veto that could be overridden.",

Modern Congresses often stay in pro forma sessions (brief meetings with no business conducted) to prevent adjournment and thus prevent pocket vetoes. Presidents have used pocket vetoes fewer than 100 times in U.S. history, compared to over 1,500 regular vetoes. The interpretation of what constitutes an adjournment that triggers a pocket veto has been subject to legal disputes and court cases."

By declaring part of an Act of Congress unconstitutional, Marshall established judicial review.",

The practice involves drawing legislative districts in ways that concentrate or dilute voting blocs, often creating oddly shaped districts that favor one party. The term originated in 1812 when Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry approved a salamander-shaped district designed to benefit his party, leading a newspaper to coin the term 'gerrymander.'",

Packing concentrates opposition voters into a few districts where they win by overwhelming margins, wasting their votes beyond what's needed to win. Cracking spreads opposition voters across many districts where they fall just short of a majority. By combining these techniques, mapmakers can secure multiple district victories for their party even when statewide vote totals are nearly even or favor the opposition.",

Common Cause that partisan gerrymandering claims are 'non-justiciable,' meaning federal courts cannot hear them.

        "The primary purpose of the census, conducted every 10 years, is to determine congressional representation. Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution mandates an 'actual Enumeration' of the population to fairly distribute seats in the House of Representatives among the states. After each census, states may gain or lose House seats through reapportionment based on population changes, and district boundaries are redrawn to reflect new population distributions.",
        "The census also determines how many electoral votes each state receives in presidential elections, since electoral votes equal the total of House seats plus Senate seats. Beyond representation, census data guides the distribution of over $1.5 trillion in annual federal funding for schools, hospitals, roads, and other infrastructure. It provides crucial data for businesses, researchers, and government planning at all levels.",
        "The Constitution originally required counting 'free Persons' and 'three fifths of all other Persons' (enslaved people), excluding 'Indians not taxed.' The 14th Amendment eliminated the three-fifths clause after slavery was abolished. Today, the census aims to count every person residing in the U.S., regardless of citizenship status—though recent administrations have debated adding a citizenship question, raising concerns about undercounting immigrant communities who might fear responding."

        "0": "Tax collection is not the primary purpose of the census, though the Constitution originally linked representation and 'direct Taxes' to be apportioned by population. Today, the census does not determine tax obligations. Its primary purpose is determining how many House seats each state receives and how electoral votes are distributed.",
        "2": "Military recruitment is not a purpose of the census. The census counts population for representation purposes, not to identify potential military service members. Military recruitment is handled separately by the Department of Defense through voluntary enlistment or, historically, through draft registration (which is separate from the census).",
        "3": "While census data does inform federal funding formulas for schools, school funding is not the primary purpose of the census. The Constitution mandates the census specifically for determining congressional representation. The use of census data for federal funding distribution is an important secondary application, but apportioning House seats is the constitutional purpose."
