In this situation, the bill automatically dies and cannot become law. Unlike a regular veto, a pocket veto cannot be overridden by Congress because Congress is no longer in session.",

This gives the President a powerful tool at the end of congressional sessions, allowing them to kill legislation without taking the political risk of an explicit veto that could be overridden.",

Modern Congresses often stay in pro forma sessions (brief meetings with no business conducted) to prevent adjournment and thus prevent pocket vetoes. Presidents have used pocket vetoes fewer than 100 times in U.S. history, compared to over 1,500 regular vetoes. The interpretation of what constitutes an adjournment that triggers a pocket veto has been subject to legal disputes and court cases."

By declaring part of an Act of Congress unconstitutional, Marshall established judicial review.",

The practice involves drawing legislative districts in ways that concentrate or dilute voting blocs, often creating oddly shaped districts that favor one party. The term originated in 1812 when Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry approved a salamander-shaped district designed to benefit his party, leading a newspaper to coin the term 'gerrymander.'",

Packing concentrates opposition voters into a few districts where they win by overwhelming margins, wasting their votes beyond what's needed to win. Cracking spreads opposition voters across many districts where they fall just short of a majority. By combining these techniques, mapmakers can secure multiple district victories for their party even when statewide vote totals are nearly even or favor the opposition.",

Common Cause that partisan gerrymandering claims are 'non-justiciable,' meaning federal courts cannot hear them.

        "The main issue in [United States v. Nixon](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1973/73-1766) was executive privilege versus judicial oversight. This 1974 [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) case happened during the Watergate scandal. President Richard Nixon refused to give special prosecutors audio tapes of White House conversations. He claimed executive privilege, which is the president's right to keep some communications private. The question was whether a president could refuse to provide evidence in a criminal investigation.",
        "The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Nixon had to turn over the tapes. The justices said that while executive privilege does exist, it is not unlimited. The need for evidence in criminal cases is more important than keeping presidential conversations secret. This decision established an important principle: no person, not even the president, is above the law. The ruling strengthened the system of checks and balances by confirming that federal courts have the power to review executive branch actions.",
        "The case had immediate effects. Nixon released the tapes, which showed he had tried to cover up the Watergate break-in. He resigned from office shortly after. The decision remains important today because it clarifies the limits of presidential power and confirms that the [judicial branch](https://www.usa.gov/branches-of-government) can hold the executive branch accountable."

The case involved whether states could pay salary supplements to teachers at religious schools.",

Second, its primary effect must neither advance nor inhibit religion. Third, it must not create excessive entanglement between government and religion. If a law fails any one of these three parts, courts may rule it violates the Establishment Clause. This test has been used in cases involving school prayer, religious displays on public property, and government funding for religious organizations.",

Some justices have criticized the test or used alternative approaches in recent decisions. Still, it continues to influence how courts examine whether government actions inappropriately involve religion. The test helps protect both religious freedom and government neutrality on religious matters."
