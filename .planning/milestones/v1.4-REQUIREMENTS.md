# Requirements: Civic Trivia Championship v1.4

**Defined:** 2026-02-20
**Core Value:** Make civic learning fun through game show mechanics — play, not study

## v1.4 Requirements

Requirements for Fremont, CA Collection. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Collection Setup

- [x] **COLL-01**: Fremont, CA collection exists in database with slug `fremont-ca`, description, theme color, and sort order
- [x] **COLL-02**: Fremont collection has 8 topic categories (city government, county government, state government, civic history, local services, elections & voting, landmarks & culture, budget & finance)
- [x] **COLL-03**: Fremont collection card displays a skyline banner image (`fremont-ca.jpg`)

### Question Content

- [x] **QUES-01**: ~100 questions across 8 topic categories with weighted distribution (18-20 each for civic history and landmarks/culture, 8-15 for others)
- [x] **QUES-02**: All questions have cited sources with URLs from official or authoritative sources
- [x] **QUES-03**: All questions pass quality rules (dinner party test, civic utility, no pure lookup facts, no phone numbers/addresses)
- [x] **QUES-04**: Questions have balanced difficulty distribution (easy/medium/hard)
- [x] **QUES-05**: Time-sensitive questions (current officials, budget figures) have `expiresAt` timestamps matching term end dates
- [x] **QUES-06**: Questions include explanations (1-3 sentences, neutral, informative)

### Fremont-Specific Content Quality

- [x] **FREM-01**: Mission San Jose questions disambiguate between the 1797 Spanish mission and the modern Fremont district
- [x] **FREM-02**: Tesla/NUMMI questions focus on civic angles (economic impact, manufacturing evolution) not pure corporate trivia
- [x] **FREM-03**: Five-district consolidation story (1956) represented across multiple questions
- [x] **FREM-04**: Little Kabul / Afghan-American community represented with cultural sensitivity
- [x] **FREM-05**: Ohlone/Indigenous history treated with appropriate sensitivity
- [x] **FREM-06**: Diversity and demographic questions use percentages/trends, not exact population numbers

### Activation & Playability

- [x] **ACTV-01**: Fremont collection seeded to database via community seed script
- [x] **ACTV-02**: Collection activated (`isActive: true`) and appears in collection picker
- [x] **ACTV-03**: Collection has minimum 50 questions (gameplay threshold) — targeting ~100
- [x] **ACTV-04**: Game sessions can be created from Fremont collection with 8-question rounds

## Future Requirements

Deferred to later milestones.

### Additional Collections

- **COLL-FUT-01**: Additional Bay Area city collections (San Jose, Oakland, etc.)
- **COLL-FUT-02**: Alameda County collection (county-wide scope)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Fremont-specific UI customization | Collection system is generic, no per-collection UI theming |
| Video/image questions about Fremont landmarks | Text-only format established in v1.0 |
| Real-time Fremont civic data integration | Static question bank with expiration dates sufficient |
| Automatic question generation from live city council feeds | AI generation + manual review pipeline sufficient |
