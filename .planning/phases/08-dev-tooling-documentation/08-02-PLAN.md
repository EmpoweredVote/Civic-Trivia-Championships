<objective>
Create the missing Phase 3 VERIFICATION.md and do a light audit of all v1.0 documentation.

Purpose: Phase 3 (Scoring System) is the only v1.0 phase missing its VERIFICATION.md. This plan reconstructs it from code analysis (LOCKED DECISION — not live testing) and audits existing docs for obvious inaccuracies.
Output: Complete Phase 3 VERIFICATION.md and an audit summary of existing documentation quality.

  <name>Task 1: Reconstruct Phase 3 VERIFICATION.md from code analysis</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/03-scoring-system/03-VERIFICATION.md</files>
  <action>
    Create 03-VERIFICATION.md by analyzing the Phase 3 codebase and documentation. This is reconstructed from code analysis, NOT live testing (LOCKED DECISION).

    1. **Read existing Phase 3 SUMMARYs** (03-01, 03-02, 03-03) to understand what was built.

    2. **Read the source files** referenced in the SUMMARYs to verify actual implementation:
       - Backend: session service, score calculation, API endpoints (look in backend/src/services/, backend/src/routes/)
       - Frontend: game state reducer, hooks, score display components
       - Check the Phase 3 requirements from ROADMAP: SCORE-01, SCORE-02, SCORE-04, SCORE-05

    3. **Match the format** of existing VERIFICATIONs (01 and 02). Read 01-VERIFICATION.md and 02-VERIFICATION.md for format reference. Use the same structure: requirement checklist, test evidence (from code analysis), acceptance criteria status.

    4. **Document these Phase 3 success criteria** (from roadmap):
       - Scores calculated server-side with base points and speed bonuses
       - Score displayed throughout game
       - Evidence from code: session service scoring logic, speed bonus tiers (>=15s: +50, >=5s: +25, <5s: +0), anti-cheat plausibility checks, score animations

    5. **Mark each requirement with evidence** from code analysis (file paths, function names, key logic) rather than test run outputs.

  <verify>
    1. File exists: `.planning/phases/03-scoring-system/03-VERIFICATION.md`
    2. File references all Phase 3 requirements (SCORE-01, SCORE-02, SCORE-04, SCORE-05)
    3. File contains code evidence (file paths, function references)
    4. Format matches existing VERIFICATIONs (01, 02)
  </verify>
  <done>Phase 3 VERIFICATION.md exists with requirement coverage, code-based evidence, and acceptance criteria — consistent with the format used in Phases 1, 2, 4-7.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Light audit of existing v1.0 documentation</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/03-scoring-system/03-VERIFICATION.md</files>
  <action>
    Do a light audit of all v1.0 phase documentation (Phases 1-7). This is a SCAN, not a deep review (LOCKED DECISION — existing docs left as-is unless clearly wrong).

    1. **Check completeness:** Verify each phase (1-7) has: all PLANs, all SUMMARYs, VERIFICATION.md. List any gaps (Phase 3 VERIFICATION was the known gap — confirm no others).

    2. **Spot-check accuracy:** For each phase, skim the VERIFICATION.md and compare against the roadmap requirements listed for that phase. Flag anything obviously wrong (e.g., requirement listed as passed but feature clearly not implemented, wrong file paths, incorrect descriptions).

    3. **Document findings:** Add an "Audit Notes" section at the bottom of the Phase 3 VERIFICATION.md (since that's the file we're already creating). Include:
       - Completeness check results (all phases have full doc sets: yes/no, list gaps)
       - Any inaccuracies found (or "No obvious inaccuracies found")
       - This section should be brief (10-20 lines max)

    Do NOT modify any existing documentation files. Only flag issues in the audit notes.
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. `grep -l "Audit" .planning/phases/03-scoring-system/03-VERIFICATION.md` returns a match
    2. Audit section mentions all 7 phases
  </verify>
  <done>Light audit complete. All v1.0 phases checked for doc completeness and obvious inaccuracies. Results documented in audit notes section.</done>

<verification>
1. `ls .planning/phases/03-scoring-system/03-VERIFICATION.md` confirms file exists
2. All v1.0 phases (1-7) have PLANs, SUMMARYs, and VERIFICATIONs
3. Phase 3 VERIFICATION references all 4 scoring requirements
4. Audit notes section present with completeness and accuracy findings
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Phase 3 VERIFICATION.md exists and follows the same format as other phases
- All Phase 3 requirements (SCORE-01, SCORE-02, SCORE-04, SCORE-05) documented with code evidence
- Light audit confirms all v1.0 phases have complete documentation
- Any inaccuracies flagged (or explicitly noted as "none found")
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/08-dev-tooling-documentation/08-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
