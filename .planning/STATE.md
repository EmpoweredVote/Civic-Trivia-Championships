## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.3]: Admin auth is security prerequisite -- must ship before any new admin features
- [v1.3]: Telemetry schema early so gameplay data accumulates while building other features
- [v1.3]: Quality rules before admin UI -- UI needs scores to display

### Pending Todos

- [ ] Announce v1.2 Community Collections launch (320 total questions live)
- [ ] Invite volunteers to GitHub org
- [ ] Share live URLs with team

### Blockers/Concerns

- REQUIREMENTS.md lists 22 requirements but only 20 are defined in the traceability table. Coverage validated against the 20 actual requirements.
